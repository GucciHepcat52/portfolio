            I love software and tech. Seeing how much technology can improve the
            lives of others is why I am in this industry. I seek to exemplify
            myself in work ethic, moral standing, decisive management and a
            visionary approach to product and technical development. I have
            worked hard to build myself into someone who is coachable, reliable
            and adaptable to any business environment.
